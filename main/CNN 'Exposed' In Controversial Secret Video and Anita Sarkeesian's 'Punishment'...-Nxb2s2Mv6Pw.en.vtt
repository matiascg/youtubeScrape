00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.500
You beautiful bastards

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:07.200
Hope you having a fantastic Tuesday welcome back to the Philip Defranco show and let's just jump into it the first thing

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.519
I want to talk about today one of the most requested stories of the day today is an update on the

00:00:11.889 --> 00:00:13.650
Craziness out of Vidcon yesterday

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:19.350
Specifically we're talking about creator and panelist Anita Sarkeesian being on a panel calling someone in the crowd

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.029
Who's made videos about her in the past?

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:22.890
a garbage human and a shithead

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:28.199
They wrote look we don't want our panelists who insults our audience members even when we completely understand that the comment exists and a much

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:31.259
broader and pretty messed up context is seemingly in reference to

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:36.209
Sargon's past with Anita it continued even when people have said hateful things that everyone in our office

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:39.989
Disagrees with we have a policy and it exists not just to protect people at the show

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.839
But to protect our ability to have these conversations our founder

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.309
Hank Green talked with our panelists and said two things he told her that her comment had violated our policy

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:52.198
but that he understood there was a broader contact which should be clear we were blissfully ignorant of until this weekend - he

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:58.259
Apologized to her for not having been more aware of and active and understanding the situation before the event which resulted in her being subjected

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.250
To a hostile environment that she had not signed up for and on that note of the hostile environment

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.839
They wrote this year we had a contingent of attendees some who paid some who snuck in with fake passes

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:13.470
We've been either perpetrators of this harassment or had for years watched of the outrage they cultivated resulted in followers daxing harassing

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:19.319
Intimidating and even threatening the lives of the creators on these panels it is difficult to imagine that this group of people who are aware?

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:24.479
That their channels been base camps for years of harassment of some of our panelists did not realize that they're arriving early to fill up

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.209
The three front rows of a panel was going to be intimidated in any case

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.659
It looks like intentional intimidation to most people in attendance and the panelists were

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:37.679
Understandably on Edge throughout the discussion so from this response what what is the net result despite violating Vidcon policy it doesn't look like anita

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.680
Was kicked out and while it does seem like Vidcon

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:46.919
Sympathizes with her it also doesn't at least at least in this article never overtly say they're going to bar the people that have been

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.299
Trolling their word also

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:52.078
There's this weird line that he includes in here that I need to touch down rights

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:58.019
But one specific note if people attend Vidcon to collect footage to later use and videos that criticize not just ideas the focus the outrage

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.759
Of their followers on individuals it will not be welcome back, but that kind of doesn't make sense. Yes

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:06.479
They were filming this panel where people were openly discussing ideas

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:12.359
You're essentially criticizing someone for filming someone as you even said breaking Vidcon policy

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:17.670
It's a showcasing of actions of an individual it seems a bit ridiculous to me if I go to a markiplier panel

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:21.720
And I want to film him because I want to I want to expose what I think are flaws in his open

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:27.510
Argument, and at he at one point says Philip Defranco's a little bitch, baby. That is my filming they can either bad guy

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.819
Here's what I'll say. I'm a fan of Vidcon

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:33.598
I'm a fan of john and hank who of course started personally believe this movie's weak

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:34.950
And I don't agree with it of course

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:38.369
I don't run the gun you say someone and need a violated Vidcon policy

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:41.759
But you also kind of understand where it came from also adding that one of the founders

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:46.649
Apologized to her she would then go on to be on another panel where the reports came out later

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:48.519
and then he even made a video on it a

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:53.999
YouTuber by the name of Boogie that he was scared of offending her the entire panel and then after the panel she yelled at him

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.899
And luckily they were able to talk about but still that is that is an aggressive person

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.720
Not saying sargon or anyone else out there that they're the good guys

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:05.730
I openly said to him that I don't agree with a lot of what he and a lot of the people that he talks to

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:10.170
Believe in but I've also engaged in conversation it does raise the question I understand

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:13.559
We don't live in a world where it's just it's black and white right there there are areas of grey

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.560
What is the point of having a policy in place?

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:17.079
when people

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:22.499
Break that policy and the net result is you apologize to them but from that. I want to share some stuff

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:26.880
I love today and today in awesome brought to you by CGC geek of course fantastic

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:30.809
Take it after takes the confusion out of buying tickets. They put all the tickets in one place

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:34.139
I give it a 0 to 100 score to let you know how good of a deal

00:03:34.139 --> 00:03:35.819
You're getting I have the app on my phone

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:39.268
And it is by far the easiest way to buy tickets for a baseball game

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:44.128
Concert other things human people do and if you're intrigued those beautiful bastards over at C

00:03:44.129 --> 00:03:46.948
Geeks set up coupon code fill for $20 off your first

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:50.429
Ticket purchase link to download the app is in the description the first bit of awesome

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:53.790
Is that Nintendo America has now officially announced the snes?

00:03:54.310 --> 00:04:01.049
Classic edition, it's $79.99. It will have 21 games and it's coming out september 29 also unlike the nes classic edition

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:06.479
They include two controllers not just one games included earthbound Super Mario world the legend of Zelda Link to the past

00:04:06.669 --> 00:04:11.669
Donkey Kong country a ton of other games and the one that stands out to me the most is the never before

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:15.749
Officially released star fox 2 and I will say I'm kind of pumped about this as my kid gets older

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:20.190
I wanted to be able to play through the classic the only thing I feel like I'm going to hate about this is that the

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:25.919
Controller has such a small court. I don't know if it'll be the same as the nes classic, but those were horrible, but

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:29.370
Is crossed and we had GQ putting out a video. We're tattoo artists

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:33.090
We're critiquing the tattoos of Celebrity photos Gonna be a dumb video finish it up

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:34.650
I became an Oliver peck fan man

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:39.479
If you need to daily dose of what the fuck we have a new side night and happiness short as I watched out putting out

00:04:39.479 --> 00:04:44.549
A video of parents giving their kids sex advice and if you want to see the full versions everything I just share the secret link

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:49.530
Of the day anything at all links is always are in the description down below then let's talk about the huge news

00:04:49.599 --> 00:04:55.289
Around Google after fighting a legal battle in the eu for the past seven years google has been fined

00:04:56.229 --> 00:04:59.729
2.7 billion dollars as far as the reason for this massive fine

00:04:59.729 --> 00:05:06.089
It's because of how google handles shopping searches the e use competition commissioners saying what google has done is illegal under eu

00:05:06.639 --> 00:05:10.948
Antitrust Rules if tonight other companies the chance to compete on the merits and to innovate and most

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:16.079
importantly it Denied European consumers a genuine choice of services and the full benefits of innovation

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:21.629
So what did google do is that after years long? Analysis they found that Google skewed search results to promote to their

00:05:21.759 --> 00:05:28.468
services over competitor adding that on average Google only links to competitors by page four in the search results and in respond to this as

00:05:28.469 --> 00:05:34.199
You might expect google says they do not agree with this judgment adding that they're considering an appeal and walker senior VP and senior counsel

00:05:34.199 --> 00:05:39.689
At Google say when you shop online you want to find the products you're looking for quickly and easily and advertisers want to promote those

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:40.409
same products

00:05:40.409 --> 00:05:44.069
That's why Google shows shopping ads connecting our users with thousands of advertisers

00:05:44.199 --> 00:05:50.939
Large and small ways they're useful for both while some comparison shopping sites naturally want google to show them more prominently our data shows that

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:52.229
people usually Prefer link

00:05:52.229 --> 00:05:56.249
So take them directly to the products they want not to web sites where they have to repeat their searches

00:05:56.250 --> 00:06:00.119
Here's a tricky part of the Eu commission has given google 90 days to quote

00:06:00.219 --> 00:06:05.609
Stop its illegal conduct give equal treatment to Rival price comparison services reportedly. It's up to Google to choose

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:11.129
How it plans to give equal treatment to competitors and inform that you of its plans within 60 days and if Google fails to comply?

00:06:11.129 --> 00:06:14.759
They are at risk of having to pay up to five percent of their daily revenue

00:06:14.759 --> 00:06:19.468
It'll be very interesting to see what happens from here the eu has slammed Google

00:06:19.469 --> 00:06:22.379
But they've also not told them what to do to fix it

00:06:22.379 --> 00:06:25.619
Just saying fix it let us know how you plan on fixing it and okay?

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:28.979
We'll hopefully hear from you in 60 days, and we'll just have to wait and see what happens

00:06:28.979 --> 00:06:33.299
But we do know the Eu takes us very seriously well two point seven two billion dollar fine

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:38.550
Isn't the end of days for Google alphabet because it's estimated they have around 90 billion dollars

00:06:38.979 --> 00:06:44.949
Hanging around still more than two and a half times the highest fine ever imposed for anti-competitive behavior in the eu

00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:52.779
oh wait and see then an interesting advertiser names according to researchers from the university of Illinois after examining 78 peer-reviewed studies between

00:06:53.300 --> 00:07:00.639
1969 and 2017 they say that sex does not sell specifically. I mean lead to the purchase of items

00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:03.129
I'm sorry to tell you this Carl's Jr.. Even though

00:07:03.130 --> 00:07:08.950
They actually recently changed up their whole campaign what the researchers found is that while participants who took in?

00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:15.520
Advertising were more likely to remember something that was sexual he found the participants were less likely to remember the brand's being

00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:18.880
Advertised and if they did remember the brand's they were more likely to have a negative

00:07:19.250 --> 00:07:26.170
thought about that brand ultimately the reports lead author said these aren't literally zero effect on participants intention to buy products and ads with a

00:07:26.170 --> 00:07:29.709
Sexual appeal to me this makes sense. It's kind of like those Carl's Jr.

00:07:29.710 --> 00:07:31.280
Ads you know you remember the one with Kate upton?

00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:37.390
And you remember the one with Charlotte McKinney those ads were seemingly way more beneficial for them than it was for the Carl's Jr.

00:07:37.550 --> 00:07:39.550
Brand the people wanted to see those girls

00:07:39.550 --> 00:07:43.060
We're very happy and most likely one to see those girls moan about you

00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:45.399
But there's nothing that really translates from the thought of ooh

00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:50.470
I really like to see stuff and Kate upton's mouths who I should probably buy a burger from a fast food place

00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:55.359
it doesn't make sense now granted if you're trying to draw views then yes my entire YouTube career between

00:07:55.820 --> 00:08:01.359
2006 to 2014 can attest to that. That's more akin to if Kate upton was at a Carl's Jr.

00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:05.920
And you went there, and you're actually able to eat the product the burger not kate ups and then you get that handout

00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:09.580
But in just something visual no and my ultimate Takeaway is sex still sells

00:08:09.580 --> 00:08:16.089
But sex just sells sex actually on the note of sex appeal in a place that you would not normally expect it

00:08:16.090 --> 00:08:17.770
Let's talk about the Czech Republic

00:08:17.770 --> 00:08:20.199
that's because we have a story out of the czech republic about a

00:08:20.390 --> 00:08:26.169
Nuclear power plant that was bringing on in turn and the management there decided that the best way to pick the best

00:08:26.420 --> 00:08:28.130
Intern would be to make this

00:08:28.130 --> 00:08:31.809
Democratic so after they narrowed it down to the top 10 finalists for the intern

00:08:31.940 --> 00:08:38.200
position they opened it up to a public vote and said whichever intern gets the most likes on these Facebook posts that is going to

00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:41.679
Be our win thing is all of the potential interns were female high school

00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:48.489
Graduates that hosed in Bikinis and hard hats inside of the cooling tower in the nuclear power plant

00:08:48.490 --> 00:08:50.710
Whoever won would get the internship and be crowned

00:08:51.350 --> 00:08:52.500
2017

00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:56.690
Energy as you'd expect once this one public there were people shouting. This is sexist

00:08:56.690 --> 00:08:57.270
this is

00:08:57.270 --> 00:09:03.409
Disgusting why wouldn't you hire an intern based on their merits and not their looks in response to all of this they remove the pictures

00:09:03.410 --> 00:09:09.110
Of the girls they remove the post and they issued an apology saying we didn't want to offend anyone purpose of the competition was to

00:09:09.110 --> 00:09:10.310
promote technical education

00:09:10.310 --> 00:09:15.169
But if the original vision raised doubts or concerns we are very sorry as far as who got to be miss

00:09:15.270 --> 00:09:18.829
Energy at no wonder portal II didn't announce a winner, but they did offer

00:09:19.350 --> 00:09:21.830
internships to all 10 finalists and firstly

00:09:21.830 --> 00:09:26.419
I just want to know how did this become a real thing who proposed this and everyone was like yeah

00:09:26.420 --> 00:09:30.500
I mean did anyone say the concept out loud before jumping dick first into it

00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:31.610
We need interns

00:09:31.610 --> 00:09:33.830
But I want to see what they look like almost naked

00:09:34.140 --> 00:09:39.169
Also, people should vote on who looks the best in that if it's just for promotion sure people can dislike it

00:09:39.170 --> 00:09:44.870
But it's just for promotion even though we've talked about sex not selling when you turn it into part of an internship

00:09:45.630 --> 00:09:48.529
Application it's dirty. I mean the concept it sounds like a porn

00:09:48.529 --> 00:09:51.019
I would watch but it has no place in the real world

00:09:51.020 --> 00:09:57.289
and then let's talk about the other most requested stories of the day today the Cnn Donald trump cluster fry it is

00:09:57.660 --> 00:09:59.900
Something and to start it up. Let's talk about Cnn

00:09:59.900 --> 00:10:06.499
You are fake Donald a damn second please we have 3 Cnn journalists who resigned after Cnn had to pull a trump russia-related?

00:10:06.690 --> 00:10:13.669
Story in the three of resign you hewlett surprised nominee Thomas Frank who wrote the story hewlett sir winner and assistant managing Editor Eric Lichtblau

Investigative unit the article was about anthony scaramouche

00:10:20.089 --> 00:10:22.249
Anthony's a hedge fund manager and a member of Trump's

00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:28.729
Transition team and linked him to an executive from the Russian direct investment fund supposedly being investigated by the senate story claim that scar moochie

00:10:28.730 --> 00:10:34.310
Met with the executive whose ten billion dollar fund makes investments in Russian companies four days before Trump's

00:10:34.470 --> 00:10:38.930
Inauguration the articles cited an anonymous source the source said that the senate intelligence committee is

00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:45.409
Investigating the Russian fund in connection with its examination of discussions between white house Adviser Jared Kushner and the head of a prominent Russian bank

00:10:45.410 --> 00:10:45.990
a bank

00:10:45.990 --> 00:10:46.620
veb

00:10:46.620 --> 00:10:54.020
Oversees the fund which has ties to several trump advisors the source saying two democratic senators asked Treasury to investigate whether Skaar Moochie promised to

00:10:54.020 --> 00:10:56.809
Lift sanctions policy shift that would help the fund attract more

00:10:56.940 --> 00:11:02.779
International Investment to Russia after Cnn published this story of scaramouche he went to Twitter writing. It's okay. I did nothing wrong

00:11:02.779 --> 00:11:04.370
They're hitting friends of potus

00:11:04.370 --> 00:11:10.410
we're loyal Advocates on his behalf and the rDI at the Russian Direct investment fund responded Cnn's report contains factual inaccuracies

00:11:10.540 --> 00:11:14.099
Which we have pointed out to the journal is concerned and expect to be corrected

00:11:14.100 --> 00:11:14.820
No Amendments

00:11:14.820 --> 00:11:15.660
Have been made so far

00:11:15.660 --> 00:11:21.329
and there are reports for another anonymous source that there might be a lawsuit around this story the next thing we knew Cnn remove the

00:11:21.330 --> 00:11:27.389
article and all links to the article and they replaced it with this editor's note that reads on June 22nd 2017 cnn.com

00:11:27.670 --> 00:11:30.149
published a story connecting Anthony Scara Moochie with

00:11:30.220 --> 00:11:36.870
Investigations into the RD is the story did not meet Cnn's editorial standards and has been retracted links to the story have been disabled Cnn

00:11:37.030 --> 00:11:41.190
Apologizes to Mr.. Scar Meucci Lex Harris also Released a statement saying on Friday Cnn

00:11:41.190 --> 00:11:44.219
Retracted the story published by my team as executive editor of that team

00:11:44.220 --> 00:11:47.730
I have resigned I've been with Cnn since 2001 and I'm sure about one thing

00:11:47.730 --> 00:11:50.940
This is a news organization the prize is accuracy and fairness above all else

00:11:50.940 --> 00:11:51.540
I am leaving

00:11:51.540 --> 00:11:53.579
But will carry those principles wherever I go

00:11:53.730 --> 00:11:59.009
while Cnn has not come out and said that the story is false stating only that the facts were quote not solid enough for

00:11:59.110 --> 00:12:04.769
Publication and that the standard editorial processes were not followed when the article was published now in response to this scara Moochie tweeted

00:12:04.770 --> 00:12:07.980
CnN did the right thing classy bulgy except everyone makes mistakes?

00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:13.050
Moving on but the same could not be said for president Donald trump who took to Twitter to say wow Cnn

00:12:13.050 --> 00:12:17.519
Had a retract big story on Russia with three employees forced to resign what about all the other phony stories

00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:19.380
They do fake news see Donald

00:12:19.380 --> 00:12:24.150
I told you you get your turn Donald trump later adding bacon new Cnn is looking at big management changes now

00:12:24.150 --> 00:12:27.959
They got caught falsely pushing the phony russian stories ratings way down

00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:30.540
so they caught fake news cn N cold but what about

00:12:30.700 --> 00:12:32.020
NBC, cBs and Abc

00:12:32.020 --> 00:12:35.759
What about the failing New York times in Washington Post's they are all fake news

00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:41.819
But that was not the end of Cnn's troubles to the story and undercover video blew up today called

00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:43.979
CnN producer says Russian narrative

00:12:44.050 --> 00:12:49.979
bullshit and the description reads jon bon afield as a senior producer at CnN admits to several beliefs that are in direct conflict with the

00:12:49.980 --> 00:12:54.990
official Cnn narrative that trump had colluded with russia and that russia has interfered with the 2016 election

00:12:54.990 --> 00:12:58.049
So outside let's look at some of the videos so you really like the russia things a little

00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:01.959
Crazy right even if Russia was trying to swing lecture night

00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:08.800
We try to swing their lectures. We are in the rcIa doing shit all the time we're out there trying to manipulate

00:13:09.350 --> 00:13:11.859
governments like the Mafia and constantly like

00:13:12.470 --> 00:13:14.330
Russia the thrust of that

00:13:14.330 --> 00:13:20.979
This is rating goes rating our ratings are incredible right now fingers just to give you some context

00:13:22.070 --> 00:13:23.270
President trump

00:13:23.270 --> 00:13:28.869
pulled out of the climate accord and for a day and a half to cover the climate quotes in the ceo of

00:13:28.940 --> 00:13:34.090
CnN and in our internal meaning if it good job everybody covering the climate accords

00:13:35.330 --> 00:13:40.960
But we're done with that. Let's get back to Russia. I mean I understand all ratings right? It's a big long

00:13:41.750 --> 00:13:44.739
Business people are like the media as like an ethical

00:13:46.280 --> 00:13:48.280
but

00:13:48.650 --> 00:13:54.699
All the night's cutie little epics. They get talked about in journalism school years. I like that's adorable

00:13:56.780 --> 00:13:58.780
galore all of this

00:13:58.910 --> 00:14:01.629
Especially cable, you know

00:14:02.360 --> 00:14:07.630
Cable news in New York time they got to do what they got to do to make their money. They I love that

00:14:07.630 --> 00:14:09.190
I love the news business

00:14:09.190 --> 00:14:12.099
I find it. So very cynical about it

00:14:12.920 --> 00:14:20.409
At the same time store most of my comb and not alone honestly you think the whole Russia shit. It's just like bullshit

00:14:21.410 --> 00:14:25.870
Could be bullshit. I mean we go sir right now like we don't have any

00:14:27.110 --> 00:14:28.610
vagina

00:14:28.610 --> 00:14:30.020
proof

00:14:30.020 --> 00:14:33.369
But then they say well, there's still an investigation going on anyway

00:14:34.220 --> 00:14:38.830
Yeah, I don't know you're finding something here. What we know about it, okay?

00:14:38.830 --> 00:14:44.049
So coming out of that for those of you that are new here. I have been a big critic of Siena granted

00:14:44.050 --> 00:14:46.270
I've also been a critic of many other news outlets

00:14:46.270 --> 00:14:50.590
But just just so you know that before moving forward there are a few things that need to be pointed out so that you feel

00:14:50.590 --> 00:14:57.369
Like you're getting all of the information you need the viruses that project veritas and James o'keefe seem to be making this producer seem more

00:14:57.380 --> 00:14:59.650
Important than he is because he's not a political producer

00:14:59.650 --> 00:15:03.999
He is the producer of Cnn health if I want the us stats on ingrown Toenail D

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:04.690
I'm going to go to John

00:15:04.690 --> 00:15:10.090
But I don't know why I would go to him for politics now as far as the russia stuff being bullshit or Mostly bullshit way

00:15:10.090 --> 00:15:15.160
That it's cotton edited, and this is this is a potential issue with James o'keefe. If you've seen his past

00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:21.639
You don't know if he's saying the entire russia situation the trump russia situation or just the russian hacking situation

00:15:21.640 --> 00:15:25.210
I'm interested in the facts and I think the trump russia situation that that might be

00:15:25.820 --> 00:15:31.629
Bullshit all the information we've seen more and more of the testimony from our intelligence agencies points to Russia

00:15:31.630 --> 00:15:34.510
Did hack us russian hacking should be discussed whether you're liberal or conservative?

00:15:34.700 --> 00:15:37.629
Even states in the beginning even if russia was trying to swing an election

00:15:37.630 --> 00:15:40.780
We'd try to swing their elections doesn't sound like it's fully trying to dispute it

00:15:40.780 --> 00:15:44.679
It's almost sounds like trying to justify and to the note of trump is good for business well

00:15:44.680 --> 00:15:46.600
Yeah
No, shit when you look at CnN

00:15:46.600 --> 00:15:49.090
And Fox news you know those are biased news

00:15:49.460 --> 00:15:54.160
Organization left and right when you have a president when you have a news network that leans in

00:15:54.350 --> 00:16:00.370
Opposition to that president they go in singing with Cnn and Donald trump, and we saw with Fox news and Barack Obama

00:16:00.380 --> 00:16:03.099
I'm not saying they're apples to apples, but you have Cnn

00:16:03.950 --> 00:16:10.569
24/7 it feels like talking about trump and rush. Do you remember when we had a president Barack Obama and fox it's seemingly?

00:16:11.089 --> 00:16:17.819
Embraced birtherism U-men because I member by the way there's one story that his family doesn't even know what hospital

00:16:17.820 --> 00:16:19.650
He was born in yeah, I've heard that as well

00:16:19.650 --> 00:16:24.689
But we'll produce it and so easy here it is on TV on Billboard's whatever. Why not just bring it up

00:16:25.870 --> 00:16:32.010
Let's give it all goes back to last year when all the questions were raised was Obama born in Kenya

00:16:32.500 --> 00:16:33.780
Even if he was born in Hawaii

00:16:33.780 --> 00:16:39.749
Did he give up his citizenship when he moved to indonesia and so for me the ultimate takeaway from this is really this this kind

00:16:39.750 --> 00:16:42.840
Of just exposes what I already feel like I personally make a lot of news outlets

00:16:42.940 --> 00:16:47.549
Handle themselves like a business that is playing for a side. You know fox news was created because there need to be a

00:16:48.100 --> 00:16:50.910
Conservative news out, and there are a lot of news organizations that do that

00:16:50.910 --> 00:16:54.689
I would almost argue most a big kind of song is a very interesting guy, and he made a point

00:16:54.690 --> 00:16:59.580
And it was like it feels like these aren't even news organizations anymore. They're just activists and more and more of them

00:16:59.580 --> 00:17:00.150
Don't even hide it

00:17:00.150 --> 00:17:02.130
I feel like that covers the full spectrum

00:17:02.130 --> 00:17:07.469
Please know that if you're going to fox news is there a bright bar you go into the Cnn or the huffington post?

00:17:07.689 --> 00:17:10.529
You are you're going to a site that says weird

00:17:10.530 --> 00:17:13.109
We're doing the real thing if you really look if you challenge yourself

00:17:13.120 --> 00:17:14.579
It looks like they're playing for a team

00:17:14.579 --> 00:17:20.429
but of course beautiful about this show is we talk about the news we include all the sources down below I give my opinion but

00:17:20.430 --> 00:17:23.729
Also doesn't have to be your opinion. I want you to let me know in those comments

00:17:23.730 --> 00:17:28.260
What is your takeaway from the situation you specifically think that at Cnn. It's bad. That's it's Cnn

00:17:28.270 --> 00:17:31.560
That's garbage, or this is just representative of a bigger problem

00:17:31.560 --> 00:17:35.099
If you have a different take away from the interaction in that video. I'd love to know your thoughts

00:17:35.110 --> 00:17:38.400
